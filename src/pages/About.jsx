        <h3> Full-Stack Engineer </h3>
        <p>
          I am a self-taught full stack enginner with over 4 years of experience. 
          During undergraduate days, I engaged in programming as hobby but became 
          seriously engaged after my obtaining my professional bachelor degree in 
          Dental Surgery. I am currently interested in conventional web, web3 and 
          blockchain technologies. I am available for part-time, full-time dev
          jobs, remote or requiring relocation as may be required.
